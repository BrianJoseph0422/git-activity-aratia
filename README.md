From the video, I learned that Git is a tool used to track and manage changes in your files, 
while GitHub serves as an online platform where you can store and collaborate on those projects. 
It showed how to create a repository, make commits, and upload your work to GitHub. I also understood 
how branching and merging help teams work on the same project efficiently without interfering with 
each otherâ€™s progress.
